enONE is an R package for performing spike-in based normalization on
NAD-capped RNA sequencing data, as well as comparing and ranking the
performance of different normalization strategies. enONE also provides a
toolkit to handle NAD-RNA sequencing data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of enONE from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thereallda/enONE")
```
