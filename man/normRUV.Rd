\usage{
normRUV(
  data,
  control.idx = NULL,
  sc.idx = NULL,
  method = c("RUVg", "RUVs", "RUVse"),
  k = 1,
  drop = 0,
  log = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A un-normalized count data matrix of shape n x p, where n is
the number of samples and p is the number of features.}

\item{control.idx}{Vector of control genes' id.}

\item{sc.idx}{A numeric matrix specifying the replicate samples for which to
compute the count differences used to estimate the factors of unwanted variation.}

\item{method}{Perform RUVg or RUVs normalization.}

\item{k}{The number of factors of unwanted variation to be estimated from the data.}

\item{drop}{The number of singular values to drop in the estimation of
unwanted variation, default drop the first singular value that represent the
difference between enrichment and input.}

\item{log}{Whether to perform log2-transformation with 1 offset on data matrix,
default: TRUE.}
}
\value{
List containing normalized counts and adjust factors for adjusting unwanted variation.
