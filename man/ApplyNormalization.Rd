\usage{
ApplyNormalization(
  data,
  scaling.method = c("TC", "UQ", "TMM", "DESeq", "PossionSeq"),
  ruv.norm = TRUE,
  ruv.k = 1,
  ruv.drop = 0,
  control.idx = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A un-normalized count data matrix of shape n x p, where n is the number of samples and p is the number of features.}

\item{scaling.method}{Vector of normalization methods that are applied to the data.
Available methods are: \code{c("TC", "UQ", "TMM", "DESeq", "PossionSeq")}.
Select one or multiple methods. By default all normalization methods will be applied.}

\item{ruv.norm}{Whether to perform RUV normalization.}

\item{ruv.k}{The number of factors of unwanted variation to be estimated from the data.}

\item{ruv.drop}{The number of singular values to drop in the estimation of
unwanted variation, default drop the first singular value that represent the
difference between enrichment and input.}

\item{control.idx}{Vector of the negative control genes for RUV normalization.}

\item{sc.idx}{A numeric matrix specifying the replicate samples for which to
compute the count differences used to estimate the factors of unwanted variation.}

\item{enrich.idx}{Matrix with two rows indicating the column index of
enrichment and input samples in the raw/normalized count data matrix.
The first row is the column index of input and the second row is the
column index of enrichment samples.}

\item{spike.in.prefix}{A character specify the prefix of spike-in id.}
}
